# bespoke-synth-jams

Source for my [Bespoke Synth](bespokesynth.com) jams.

Go check out that piece of software, it's awesome, it's free and it's saved me a bunch of money I would have to otherwise spend to spike out "would I enjoy synth as a hobby".

Caveat: I love to listen to music but I know nothing about making it so if you see some choices that are glaringly stupid re: music fundamentals then that's probably why!

## Summary

The files in here are `.bsk` files which are the source format used by Bespoke Synth; all you need to do is download and install Bespoke Synth and then open the file and the rest should just work.

Most of the files are just messing around to understand the product with these notable exceptions:

- [5 - An actual track with sequenced events](5 - An actual track with sequenced events.bsk)
  - Somebody may find this useful as it demonstrate some of the following
    - Sequencers and chorders for Drums, bass, two rhythms and a lead
    - Various synths and audio effects
    - Use of the event canvas module to build the track (fade-in, cut the kick midway, fade-out)
