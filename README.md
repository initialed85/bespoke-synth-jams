# bespoke-synth-jams

Source for my [Bespoke Synth](bespokesynth.com) jams.

Go check out that piece of software, it's awesome, it's free and it's saved me a bunch of money I would have to otherwise spend to spike out "would I enjoy synth as a hobby".

Caveat: I love to listen to music but I know nothing about making it so if you see some choices that are glaringly stupid re: music fundamentals then that's probably why!

## Summary

The files in here are `.bsk` files which is the source format used by Bespoke Synth; all you need to do is download and install Bespoke Synth and then open the file and the rest should just work.

Most of the files are just messing around to understand the product with these notable exceptions that have some useful demonstrations in them:

- [5 - An actual track with sequenced events](5%20-%20An%20actual%20track%20with%20sequenced%20events.bsk)
  - Use of the event canvas module to build the track (fade-in, cut the kick midway, fade-out)
    - Toggles rampers to bring gain up and down

- [9 - Trying to sequence multiple sequences](9%20-%20Trying%20to%20sequence%20multiple%20sequences.bsk)
  - Use of the radio sequencer to rotate through drum and lead sequenes
    - Toggles pulsers to toggle sequences with converged outputs

- [11 - Alright let's try make something good with MIDI out](11%20-%20Alright%20let's%20try%20make%20something%20good%20with%20MIDI%20out.bsk)
  - Use of the radio sequencer to rotate through chord patterns
    - Toggles note gates to filter notes entering chorders with converged outputs

- [17 - MIDI and Helm and Vital.bsk](17%20-%20MIDI%20and%20Helm%20and%20Vital.bsk)
  - Use of Helm and Vital as VSTs (you'll need to source these on your own)

- [18 - Haha wtf is this it's so happy](18%20-%20Haha%20wtf%20is%20this%20it's%20so%20happy.bsk)
  - Use of Vital as VST (you'll need to source this)
  - Using a note canvas where I'd normally use a sequencer

## Update

I stopped keeping track of anything notable (in this file I mean) but feel free to check out the `.bsk` files.

I mostly just use Ableton these days, check out [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/initialed85/) if you like.
